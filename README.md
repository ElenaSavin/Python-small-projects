# python-small-projects
In collaboration with KaparaNewbie.
Python projects for computational biology class. 
Topics: Cellular Automate, Genetic algorithms and Neural networks.  

Cellular Automate with UI: 
Simulation of an epidemic with user specified probability of contagion and poplulation size when one resident is sick.
Implimented as a cellular automate in a 200*200 grid where each cell is a resident. 

Genetic algorithm:
A map with 12 polygons needs to be colored "legaly"
a legal coloring is when no two neighbours have identical colors.

Neural Network SOM:
Created a neural network in order to determine the number "drawn" on a matrix using bits.
